    This is all you need to know about the Image Captcha:

    A. Implementation

    In order to be able to use the image captcha in your project, you'll need to:

    1. Save the "Image_Captcha_Doc" directory in the same directory with the file that needs the image captcha
    2. Rename your page with a .php extension (instead of .html, if you haven't done it before) to be able to require other files later
    3. Use the code below before your submit button to be able to see the "Are you human?" checkbox

        <?php 
            require_once("Image_Captcha_Doc/PHP Templates/image_captcha_checkpoint.php");
        ?>

    4. Use the code below at the end of your page to be able to add the image captcha template to your page

        <?php 
            require_once("Image_Captcha_Doc/PHP Templates/image_captcha_template.php");
        ?>
            

    ! At the end of this process, when the user will click the submit button, you'll have a session variable $_SESSION['captcha'] which will store the result of the captcha (true / false) Based on the value of this variable, you'll be able to make your validations



    B. How to add more image sets?

    Part I (add the images):

    1. On your server, navigate to Image_Captcha_Doc/image captcha and paste a folder with your image set
    
    Part II (set the meaning of each image in code):

    1. Go to Image_Captcha_Doc/JS_Files
    2. Open the captcha-images-data.js file in your code editor
    3. Add a new object to the base array (captchaImagesData) -- check down below, you can copy paste the code
        
        {
            possibleLabels: ['plastic', 'jellyfish'],
            plastic:['plastic vs jellyfish/A1.jpg','plastic vs jellyfish/A2.jpg', 'plastic vs jellyfish/A3.jpg', 'plastic vs jellyfish/A4.jpg'],
            jellyfish:['plastic vs jellyfish/B1.jpg','plastic vs jellyfish/B2.jpg', 'plastic vs jellyfish/B3.jpg', 'plastic vs jellyfish/B4.jpg', 'plastic vs jellyfish/B5.jpg']
        },

    4. Add all your labels in the possibleLabels property (e.g: if you have a set with dogs and cats, set the possibleLabels property to  possibleLabels: ['dogs', 'cats'])
    5. For each label, create a key with its name and associate an array with the names of the images related to that key 
        (e.g: 
            dogs:['dogvscats1.png', 'dogsvscats3.png'],
            cats:['dogvscats2.png', 'dogsvscats4.png', 'dogsvscats5.png', 'dogsvscats6.png', 'dogsvscats7.png', 'dogsvscats8.png', 'dogsvscats9.png'],
        )

    !WARNING: please make sure each set has at least 9 pictures
    *RECOMANDATION: for each lable, make sure you have at least one related picture (NOT MANDATORY, BUT USEFUL AND RECOMMENDED)


    C. Change the style of the template

    The style of the image captcha template can be changed from Image_Captcha_Doc/image-captcha-template-style.css

    Let's say you want to change the purple color of the template (let's make it blue)
    You can do that in the #image-captcha-template #image-captcha-template-form selector, by changing the background-color property to blue

    *Make sure you clear your cache frequently (or you can use the !important tag when you can't see you changes live)
